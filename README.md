# CSGO Stat Tracker
A website that displays player statistics for the Valve game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Entry requires a Steam ID or username. Player statistics vary from total time played, to wins and losses, and far more. 

Note: It will be unable to find profiles that are private and/or those that do not allow the permissions to access information required by the API.
